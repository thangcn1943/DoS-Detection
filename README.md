# DoS Detection and Intrusion

## Introduction

This project focuses on intrusion detection using network traffic features and employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the KDD CUP 1999 dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/galaxyh/kdd-cup-1999-data).

## Process Overview

For detailed data processing and model selection, please refer to `preprocess_data.ipynb`.

## Reference

This project is based on methodologies described in the paper:  
**Design and Implementation of Intrusion Detection System using Convolutional Neural Network for DoS Detection**
